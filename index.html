<h2>Why the Steelers Should Stick With Justin Fields</h2>
<p>The Pittsburgh Steelers have a choice to make, continue to start quarterback Justin Fields, who has gone 3-2 and has drastically reduced his turnovers on the new team, or start veteran Russell Wilson, who is coming off both an off year, as well as a calf injury, but has much more experience than Fields. I personally believe that the Steelers should continue to start Justin Fields. While people did not expect the Steelers to be bad this year, this season was never one in which the team expected to be fighting for the Super Bowl, it was all about improving and progressing our young players, so with that in mind, why would you take out a 26 year old quarterback, who has been improving each in every game, for an aging quarterback with no chances of being on the roster next year? The coaches preach progression, saying even in loses, our goal is to get better, but how do you expect this young team to build chemistry with such a massive change 6 weeks into the season? Each and every year this team makes decisions based on the goal to "win now," but eventually they have to realize that if they want to win at all, they have to focus on the future.</p>

<h2>Why Evan Mobley Will Be an All Star</h2>
<p>I believe that Evan Mobley of the Cleveland Cavs will be an NBA All Star this year. So far through Evan Mobley's NBA career, he has had to play under coach JB Bickerstaff, a defensive minded coach who believed that Evan Mobley was used best as a defensive anchor, and never really utilized Mobley on the offensive side of the ball. Now, after JB was let go this offseason, the Cavs are being coached under Kenny Atkinson, former head coach of the Brooklyn Nets and assistant coach of the Golden State Warriors, two offensive minded teams. Kenny has made it clear this offseason that his goal is to make Mobley a key part of the offensive, and even implying that they would be playing the offense through him. With Mobley getting more chances in the offense, we are likely to see his points per game skyrocket, as we have seen in limited sample size what he can do when targeted in the paint. last season we also saw Mobley's through point shot start to fall, an area where he will now be likely to actually get some volume in, where under JB is was only seeing 1-2 shots at per game. If the Cavs are going to win this season ,they need to be utilizing Evan Mobley, and with some shot volume, I believe he will be an All Star this season.</p>
