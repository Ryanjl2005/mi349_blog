<h2>Why the Steelers Should Stick With Justin Fields</h2>
<p>The Pittsburgh Steelers have a choice to make, continue to start quarterback Justin Fields, who has gone 3-2 and has drastically reduced his turnovers on the new team, or start veteran Russell Wilson, who is coming off both an off year, as well as a calf injury, but has much more experience than Fields. I personally believe that the Steelers should continue to start Justin Fields. While people did not expect the Steelers to be bad this year, this season was never one in which the team expected to be fighting for the Super Bowl, it was all about improving and progressing our young players, so with that in mind, why would you take out a 26 year old quarterback, who has been improving each in every game, for an aging quarterback with no chances of being on the roster next year? The coaches preach progression, saying even in loses, our goal is to get better, but how do you expect this young team to build chemistry with such a massive change 6 weeks into the season? Each and every year this team makes decisions based on the goal to "win now," but eventually they have to realize that if they want to win at all, they have to focus on the future.</p>
